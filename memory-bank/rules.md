## Mandatory Rules

- **Reusable Components:** If a component can be used in multiple places, it must be separated into a reusable component and imported where needed. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- **Planning and Progressing Pattern:** Before starting any new task or work, it is mandatory to understand the planning and progressing pattern. This ensures that the work is aligned with the overall project goals and that progress is tracked effectively.
